# Handwritten Digits Recognition (TensorFlow)

A simple implementation of handwritten digit recognition using **TensorFlow/Keras**, based on concepts from the *Modern Computer Vision* course. This project trains a neural network on the **MNIST dataset** to classify digits (0–9).

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques in computer vision.  
- Dataset: [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) (70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits).  
- Framework: **TensorFlow / Keras**  
- Task: Image classification (digits 0–9).  

The goal is to understand the fundamentals of building, training, and evaluating neural networks for computer vision tasks.
